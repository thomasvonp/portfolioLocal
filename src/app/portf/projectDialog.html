		Games and entertainment are two areas that are growing and developing rapidly. Clearly games are successful and
		this has inadvertedly led to individuals breaking down games into its core components. Game developers and
		researchers are examining parts and elements of games in order to apply the addictive elements on tasks
		that are not related to games. This process is called gamification, and its purpose is to motivate users for the
		task at hand.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		A few elements from the modern game Candy Crush attracted our attention - the
		visual motion effects and animations. The purpose of this study was to examine the motivational
		influence of visual motion effects and animations. This is accomplished by selecting college students who are actively studying
		and allowing these students use a gamified application for the
		purpose of increasing their motivation. To examine this we developed a program
		where users are exposed to motion effects and animations. In the program, their self-estimated
		motivation is recorded. In addition to this type of data, more qualitative answers were recorded from
		surveys to reach a higher degree of validity of the results.

		This VR project involves multi-screen and multiplayer game design with a focus on multimodal interactions.
		The goal was to to build a virtual reality game and that was engaging not only the main player, but also to other spectators such that they can participate in the game on a main screen.
		To do this, we developed the VR-game supplemented by a website, a database and a website for spectators to browse on their mobile phones as a second screen.

		Le Bon Nobel is a tool to visualize Nobel prize laureates throughout history, from a
		development and geographical context down to an individual level.
		The aim of Le Bon Nobel is to give the user the freedom to explore Nobel prize laureates
		and find new interesting information and possible correlations, without needing any prior
		knowledge of the laureates. Additionally, we want to offer the user an objective view of the
		patterns of who the average Nobel prize laureate is, where they come from and what the
		conditions are in their respective countries.
		In terms of equality itâ€™s an issue that the vast majority of the laureates are people of the
		same gender and from the same area of the world. This tool seeks to highlight these issues
		and hopefully the users will be able to see some aspects that could be one of the sources to
		this inequality.

		The goal of this project was to create an artifact that uses physical interaction and could be useful in a library. Our group came
		up with the idea of a digital hourglass to use during studies. The purpose is to help the student find balance between studying and taking breaks.
		To use the hourglass, the user inputs the amount of time that they would prefer to study. The hourglass will then dynamically alert the user 
		of break times during the study. In order to make the interaction with the hourglass as intuitive as possible, we wanted to mimic the interactions of an analog hourglass
		as much as possible.

		Pangaea was a theoretical project about social media development with the idea of iteration. In essence, making a project, picking out the best parts and starting over and over
		led this idea to the success it was. In every iteration there were new unseen factors that required examination. Looking at social media today, 
		and most importantly what defines their success, was one of the leading goals of this project. How can we make a successful social media application? Why would people use it?
		Our group looked at important factors such as demography, smartphone availability, global interests and global activity. Many of these key points connect to 
		each other. Successful social media platforms today such as Instagram have their own winning key concepts. This project's key concept was the "fresh and live" feeling of
		the pictures users would upload.

		The animation was quickly done with the help of Moovly in order to get a short ad for the project.

		The results of the study reveal that there is an overall trend for motivational increase in using a gamified application
		within studies. The users become more motivated when they see the program as a tool, and can
		therefore streamline their learning techniques. The program that was used contained two distinct parts
		that are worth separating; gamification elements and motion effects and animations as a form of
		reward. From the results, it was concluded that the gamification elements affected the users motivation
		considerably more than the motion effects did.

		The actual program was developed in Unity (C#) with hooks into SQLite3 to store data. We opted out of MySQL simply because the tables 
		were not sufficiently big to warrant the use of MySQL. Unity connected to the SQLite3 database through a PHP server script which sent the queries and kept track of the daily
		questions in the program, as well as verifying usernames and passwords against injection attacks.

		The multimodality of this project made it possible for spectators to join with their smartphone. The main player uses a VR headset, whose
		video feed is displayed on a monitor. While others are using their smartphones to queue objects in the game, they can see their object pop up
		with an identifying icon above it for recognition of who put it there.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The game itself was developed in Unity with the HTC Vive plugins for motion tracking. The player was placed on the mat, with the two VR controllers steering the mat left and right by 
		pulling either arm upwards (to simulate pulling the corner on the mat to steer it). The result proved that the cross-platform interaction between the website and the game worked well and the experience was enjoyable for both the player and the spectators.
		However, the game suffered from some bad practices that induced cyber sickness in some players. Involuntary movement of the player tends to give this reaction,
		especially in the intro sequence before the game began.

		Something very important to note is that not only does the bubble chart represent more information in a more understandable way, but it also represents <b>change.</b> 
		Most bubble charts have a slider that represents time or change. This gives a user a distinct realization of how something changes over time depending on the parameters.
		WVS Online (the API that was used) fails to represent the important function of change. It forces you to select different
		waves which represent 4-5 years and only allows you to see it for that period of time.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		I have created a simple multigraph that takes data from not only WVS but Gapminder as well. 
		Simply select your country, and two of the parameters available.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		A very interesting symbiosis with the two datasets is that it allows a user to correlate between them.
		First off, we can see that the population has increased over the years.
		Itâ€™s safe to assume that the happiness has also increased slightly in Malaysia.
		However, do these two correlate and mean anything?
		What if we choose the CO2 emissions and see that they have been declining - does that have an indirect impact of happiness?
		This is the strong aspect of information visualization, to allow users to get ideas that they can research further.
		This is also the goal with my tool, to open eyes and let users explore outside of their box.
